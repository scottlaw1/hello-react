This repository contains my implementation of the full stack web application described in [this article](https://codeburst.io/creating-a-full-stack-web-application-with-python-npm-webpack-and-react-8925800503d9).

I use versions of npm, webpack, webpack-cli, babel, Flask, and React that are more current than the versions available at the time the article was originally published.  Other than that, everything is essentially the same.

I used [this guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) to ensure that I set up Webpack correctly.
